    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>Here's a delicious way to solve the problem of those too-big zucchini ballooning in your garden at the end of the summer: zucchini boats baked and 
    stuffed with lamb, feta, pine nuts, tomatoes, and other Mediterranean flavors!
    </p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 extra large zucchini, halved lengthwise </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 sweet onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
        <li>coarse salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>¾ cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup pine nuts</li>            
        <li>¼ cup mint leaves</li>
        <li>¼ cup mint leaves</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup mint leaves</li>
        <li>¼ cup mint leaves</li>
        <li>¾ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li></li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Step</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Use a melon baller to separate and remove seeds and pulp separately from the zucchini, carving out each half and leaving about a half-inch shell. 
            Chop zucchini pulp into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter. Discard seeds.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. 
            Add ground lamb; continue to cook and stir until lamb is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir chopped zucchini into the lamb mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. 
            Simmer mixture until the zucchini is hot, about 3 minutes. Drain excess grease. Season lamb mixture with coarse salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from heat. Stir tomato sauce, tomatoes, feta cheese, pine nuts, and 1/4 cup mint leaves through the lamb mixture; spoon into the zucchini halves. 
            Put stuffed zucchini halves into a large baking dish. Pour water into the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Mix bread crumbs and mozzarella cheese in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 cup mint leaves over the zucchini and top with the bread crumb mixture. 
            Continue baking until the top is crusty and browned, about 10 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
